# visitWarsaw

This repository is one of the first projects I've done after starting my degree at Northumbria University. It was made for the Website Development and Deployment module.

It's a very basic dynamic website built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and MySQL and deployed onto Apache server.

I've programmed a simple authentication system, search engine, e-commerce (placing, modifying, removing orders) as well as account management into it. 

Security features include SQL injection protection, hashing passwords with SHA1 as well as securing the connection with the DB.

It's not particularly fancy in terms of graphical design, the main focus was on programming.
