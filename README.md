This repository is one of the first projects I've done after starting my degree at Northumbria University. It was made for the Website Development and Deployment module.

It's a very basic dynamic website built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, SQL and deployed onto Apache server and MySQL database.

I've programmed a simple authentication system, search engine, e-commerce (placing, modifying, removing orders) as well as account management into it. 

Security features include SQL injection protection, hashing passwords with SHA1 as well as securing the connection with the DB. A config file was used to mitigate including database credentials directly in the connect file, but for the purpose of deploying it on University's infrastructure we were told to forego using it.

It's not particularly fancy in terms of graphical design, the main focus was on programming.
